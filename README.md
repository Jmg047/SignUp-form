The project features six required fields: Name, Phone #, Email, Website, and password confirmation. HTML's input field allows for passwords inputted to not be visible as the user fills it out. There are messages that pop up for each field to communicate to the user about any required formats. Script.js will change the message box under the submit button to let the user know if their form has been submitted or not. Additionally, user info is stored in a variable that is visible in the console when using "Inspect Element" on Chrome. Overall this project was a learning experience for HTML/JS form validation.
