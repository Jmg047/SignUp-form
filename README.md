The quotes and their respective authors are fetched in the .JS file from Quotes API. There is a Loader to let the user know there is activity in the back-end going on while JS fetches each quote and author. The user can click the Twitter button for the user to be redirected to twitter with a pre-populated tweet of the quote they have. The Twitter button icon was sourced from Font Awesome's icons collection.

The project features six required fields: Name, Phone #, Email, Website, and password confirmation. HTML's input field allows for passwords inputted to not be visible as the user fills it out. There are messages that pop up for each field to communicate to the user about any required formats. Script.js will change the message box under the submit button to let the user know if their form has been submitted or not. Additionally, user info is stored in a variable that is visible in the console when using "Inspect Element" on Chrome. Overall this project was a learning experience for HTML/JS form validation.
